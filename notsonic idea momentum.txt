21:54 - Dr. Melon: oh! i remembered a thing i wanted to ask ya
21:54 - Dr. Melon: i had an idea for the notsonic thingy
21:54 - Dr. Melon: wondered if it sounds like a good one or if it only sounds good in my head
21:54 - Dr. Melon: it's like this;
21:55 - Dr. Melon: the player should have a meter or bar somewhere on the hud that measures their momentum or somethin
21:55 - Dr. Melon: like, it keeps track of how fluid they're playing
21:55 - Dr. Melon: and then you can get cool abilities or something by expending the momentum you've picked up
21:55 - Dr. Melon: so you can kind of store up power by goin fast to use later
21:56 - Dr. Melon: and if you stand still or slam into things it starts to reduce the bar
21:56 - Dr. Melon: there could be things like speed gates or something that give you a boost of momentum juice or w/e as well so that new players can still use some of the cool powers
